# CS-599 Project-02
Effect of Dropout on Neural Networks
# How to Run the Code
Download/clone the repository to the local machine and run the Makefile. The local machine should contain the following software:

python version 3.6 or above 

keras 

numpy and matplotlib.
# Description
In this classification project, I will implement dropout method as a regularization term in the neural network. The size of the data set would be varied and the corresponding classification error (using dropout and without using dropout) would be measured. By this way the figure would be generated.
Function: The network will learn a function that predicts a value to represent the estimated probability that an image x has digit class k, for k=1, 2, 3, â€¦., 9.
# Dataset
Real-World Problem: Classification of Handwritten Digits
Dataset link: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
Training Observation: 60000, Test Observation: 10000 
Each observation contains a 28x28 (784 pixel) input feature. 
Each observation contains an output id (0-9) of a digit.
